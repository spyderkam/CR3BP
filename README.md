## Execution
 1. Open Unix/Linux terminal and `cd` to decired driectory.
 2. Run the `makefile` by typying `make`.
 3. Execute the created `3plan` file by running `./3plan` in the terminal.
 
The execution can probably also be done in Windows. I believe that you have to manually run the GFortran files in the order which appears in the `makefile` line 1.

## Warnings
- In my code the number 1 refers to the Earth, and number 2 refers to the Sun. This is exactly the opposite of the Wiki page where the index 1 refers to the Sun.
