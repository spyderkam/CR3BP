# Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem
When trying to find the motion of a comet (mass $m_3$) in the three-body system including the Earth and the Sun (masses $m_2$ and $m_1$ respectively; see Notes), the mass of the comet is much smaller than the other two; i.e. $m_3<<m_2<m_1$. Beacuse of theis the 3 body problem is a restricted 3 body problem; and since the two larger masses rotate
about common center of mass, this case is called a circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP).
