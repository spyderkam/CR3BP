## Execution
 1. Modify `planetary.f95` lines 22 and 23 to reflect whatever Lagrange point and initial conditions you want respectively.
 2. Open Unix/Linux terminal and `cd` to the driectory which includes the files.
 3. Run the `makefile` by typying `make`.
 4. Execute the created `3plan` file by running `./3plan` in the terminal.
 
The execution can also be done in Windows. The procedure will however probably be different to the above steps.

## Notes
- Please see the [wiki home page](https://github.com/spyderkam/CR3BP/wiki) for $\LaTeX$ write up of the problem.
- See the [wiki plots page](https://github.com/spyderkam/CR3BP/wiki/Plots) for a few plots with different initial conditions.
- IMPORTANT: In my code the number 1 refers to the Earth, and number 2 refers to the Sun. This is exactly the opposite of the [Wiki page](https://github.com/spyderkam/CR3BP/wiki) where the index 1 refers to the Sun.
